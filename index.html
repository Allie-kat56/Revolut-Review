                    <li>**Exchange Rate:** Uses the interbank rate during weekdays, which is excellent. However, a markup (typically 1%) is applied on weekends to protect against currency fluctuations.</li>
                    <li>**Transfer Fees:** Offers free international transfers up to certain limits depending on your plan (Standard, Plus, Premium, Metal, Ultra). Beyond these limits, fees apply.</li>
                    <li>**ATM Withdrawals:** Free withdrawals up to a monthly limit, after which a 2% fee is charged.</li>
                    <li>**Account Plans:** Offers free Standard accounts, but many advanced features and higher limits are tied to paid monthly subscriptions.</li>
